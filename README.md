Iterative approximate best-response algorithms for solving Distributed Constraint Optimization Problems in Signal/Collect.

About
-------------------------------------
The Signal/Collect DCOPs package offers several iterative approximate best-response algorithms for solving DCOPs. [1]

- DSAN (Distributed Simulated Annealing) [2]
- DSA with A-E variants (Distributed Stochastic Algorithm) [3] with A-E variants according to [2]
- JSFP-I (Joint Strategy Fictitious Play with Inertia) [4]
